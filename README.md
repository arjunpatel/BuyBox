<h1>BuyBox</h1>
University of California, San Diego - CSE 110

http://buybox.herokuapp.com/

Buybox was a project by 9 University of California, San Diego students. We set out to redefine marketplace. Our two major goals were to <b>cut out the clutter and make it amazingly simple to list and buy products on university campuses</b> (it takes less than 45 seconds to post an item from a smartphone). Next goal was to <b>bridge the gap between online marketplace and offline marketplace</b> and therefore we have integrated some unique features such as purchase with QR Code to make it simple to sell your digital goods offline.
